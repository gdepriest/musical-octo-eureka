    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>The Shins</strong> are an indie rock band formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1996.  The band was formed by lead man, James Mercer, as a side project to Flake Music.  Their first two records, <em>Oh Inverted World</em> (2001) and <em>Chutes Too Narrow</em> (2003), were released under Sub Pop Records and received critical acclaim.  The Shins gained mainstream attention after its single "New Slang" was featured in the film <em>Garden State</em> (2004).
    </p>
    <p>
        The band's third album, <em>Wincing the Night Away</em> (2007), peaked at number two on <em>Billboard 200</em> and earned a Grammy nomination.  The Shins then signed to Columbia records, and the band's whole lignup was changed.  After a five year hiatus, <em>Port of Morrow</em>, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012.  <em>Heartworms</em>, was released in 2017, followed by <em>The Worm's Heart</em>, a reinterpretation released in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
        With lyrics that twist the mundane into the surreal, and influences as varied as punk, folk and country, The Shins craft musical experiences.
